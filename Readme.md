# Deep Learning Mini Projects (PyTorch)

This repository contains Google Colab notebooks of mini projects exploring deep learning concepts using **PyTorch**. Each notebook focuses on different tasks, models, or techniques for learning and experimentation.

## Contents

* Mini projects implemented in PyTorch 🧑‍💻
* Hands-on experiments with various deep learning architectures 🧠

## Index

1. [**DCGAN on FashionMNIST**](./ComputerVision/DC_GAN/DCGANs_using_Fashion_mnist.ipynb) – Generating clothing images using a Deep Convolutional GAN.  
2. [**Diffusion Model (U-Net)**](./ComputerVision/Diffusion%20Model/Diffusion_on_FashionMNIST.ipynb) – Image denoising and generation with diffusion process.  
3. [**Transfer Learning (ResNet18)**](./ComputerVision/TransferLearning_ImageClassification/CatsVsDogs_ImageClassification.ipynb) – Fine-tuning a pre-trained model to classify Dogs vs Cats.  

## Getting Started

You can open any notebook directly in **Google Colab**:

```bash
Open with Colab → Run → Explore
```

## Requirements

* Python 3.x 🐍
* PyTorch 🔥
* Jupyter/Colab environment 📓

## Notes

* This repo will be updated with more projects over time ✨
